	<p>Provides SQL Streamer services to JDBC operations.</p>

	<p>A {@code SqlStreamer's} main function is to provide JDBC {@code
		ResultSet} data as a standard java {@code Stream}. At the same
		provides all standard JDBC operations so most application operations
		are done using a consistant stream based API.</p>

	<p>{@code SQL} statements are not completely replaced and you do
		have understand the basics of SQL Syntax. However using the provided
		java builder objects which chain multiple operations and validate your
		input, make it much easier to code and then handle any resulting data.</p>

	<p>This library does not load or create actual JDBC drivers and
		make any JDBC connections. This has to be done by another framework or
		using JDBC API.</p>

	<h2>Getting Started</h2>

	<p>The first thing we need to do is create a {@code SqlStreamer}
		object. Before we can create a streamer we need a {@code
		java.sql.Connection} to the database. This is done outside the
		streamer API.</p>
	<p>We use the factory method {@code
		SqlStreamerSupport.streamer(Connection)} method to create a streamer
		instance.</p>

	Here is a quick demonstration, and note that the {@code
	java.sql.DataSource} instance is already provided:
	<code>
		<pre>
java.sql.Connection connection = dataSource.getConnection();
SqlStreamer streamer = SqlStreamerSupport.streamer(connection);
	</pre>
	</code>


	<h2>Query Example</h2>

	<p>The {@code SqlStreamer.query()} invokes a SQL database query
		which will generate a JDBC {@code ResultSet} that we will be able to
		iterate over using java {@code Stream}:</p>
	<code>
		<pre>
SqlStreamer streamer = SqlStreamerSupport.streamer(connection);

streamer.query("table1")
	.select("COUNT(`col1`) AS `col2`")
	.groupBy("col2")
	.having("`col2` = 2")
	.forEach(System.out::println);
	</pre>
	</code>

	<p>
		The generated query looks something like this in SQL:
		<code>
			<pre>
SELECT 
	COUNT(`col1`) AS `col2`
FROM 
	`database1`.`table1` 
GROUP BY 
	`col2` 
HAVING 
	`col2` = 2;
</pre>
		</code>
	<p>The first stream terminator method executes the query and starts
		consuming rows from the stream which is backed by the {@code
		ResultSet}. So the last statement {@code forEach(System.out::println)} will print
